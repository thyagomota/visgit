Welcome to **VisGit**, an educational tool that allows the visualization and interaction with Git branch trees. Git commands, especially after multiple branches and merges, can be difficult to understand. **VisGit** can help users create mental models that make it easier to understand the operations performed by Git. 

**VisGit** enables users to: 

* simulate any of the Git commands, including undo commands;
* visually distinguish between branches by color;
* view the full Git branch tree for a given repository, including local or remote repositories; 
* be challenged to reproduce a given branch tree.
